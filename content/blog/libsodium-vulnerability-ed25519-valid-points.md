+++

On December 30th 2025, [Libsodium][Libsodium] author Frank Denis has published the existence of a vulnerability regarding a [missing validation of elliptic curve points for the `crypto_core_ed25519_is_valid_point`
function](https://00f.net/2025/12/30/libsodium-vulnerability/) of the Ed25519 public signature API. Fortunately, the fallout is mitigated in great part by two factors:

1. The [`libsodium-bindings`][libsodium-bindings] library does not export this low-level function;
2. If you do not use this function directly, but instead keep on using the [`CryptoSign`][CryptoSign] high-level API, you are safe.

## Affected versions

If you still need to comply with an audit, know that you are bound to be marked as "vulnerable" if you use a released version lower or equal to 1.0.20, or a version of libsodium released before December 30, 2025 (date of the publication of this vulnerabilty).

## Recommendations

For finite field arithmetic, an advanced use-case of the C library, The Libsodium project advises to switch to [Ristretto255][Ristretto255], available since Libsodium 1.0.18.
At this time, [libsodium-bindings][libsodium-bindings] does not export bindings to this particular API, although a contribution in this direction would be greatly appreciated if you or your
organisation might depend on such operations.
